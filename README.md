# ProductAPI demonstration of full unit and E2E Integration test + Automatic Swagger documentation

Built with Spring Boot, Maven, Java, and MongoDB Atlas, and Heroku.

### Testing
This application uses the capabilities of Spring Boot to bootstrap an 
application context to be used in End-2-End integration tests. Unit
testing relies on mocking using Mockito as included in the Spring-Boot-Starter
test dependency.

### Swagger Doc Generation
Spring Doc is used to automatically generate Swagger OAS 3 API 
documentation. Docs can be accessed [here](https://product-api-demo.herokuapp.com/swagger-ui/index.html).
